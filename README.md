# Inhition of Return (IOR) using ***Pychopy***

This experiment follows the procedure of the first experiment in Castel, Pratt and Drummond's (2005) [^1] paper. It's an altered version of the classic Posner and Cohen (1984) [^2] spatial attention paradigm. The experiment has three blocks, each contains 150 trials. Left and right cues were balanced for the six SOA conditions (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000ms) in the valid trial (black circle and cue appear in the same location). 



Note: This experiment was created using ***Psychopy 2020.1.3*** on ***macOS Catalina Version 10.15.7***. It is expected to see crashes on perious version of ***Psychopy*** or on ***Windows***.  If you are using an oler version or other platform, use the *older_version_IORpsychopy.psyexp* file.
